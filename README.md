# airpassengers-ARIMA
Analysing time series data by using the ARIMA method. Originally sourced from Analytics Vidhya. To run this program, I would suggest downloading Anaconda for Python 3. Once the installation is complete, type and execute the following into the terminal:

"jupyter notebook"

This will open up Jupyter notebook in your browser. From there, navigate to the "airpassengers_ts.ipynb" file and open it up. I have included my own notes on the theoretical concepts behind this model and the methods used in the .ipynb file. I hope it helps!
